# Week #3: Course Materials
  * Razor Syntax
  * .NET Core MVC
  * Nuget package manager


The primary objective of week #2 is to develop the business logic  fully to list/apply/approve/deny leave applications. 

We will also start doing standups from this week. https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/scrum/meetings/daily-scrum

Each day, as the team does the standup, one from each team notes down briefly the answers to the three questions for each team member and send it to the facilitators.

  Here is a rough format (for each team)

  Subject: FTP{nn} daily standup â€“ {date}
  
{team member#1}:
  * Yesterday:
    * Completed {blah}, In progress {blah}
  * Today:
    * Will complete {blah}, Will start {blah}
  * Impediments:
    * {Things like machine issues, network issues etc}
    
{team member #2:
   * ...
   
Ideally, the blahs above should include the ticket number FTP{nn}-{jj}
